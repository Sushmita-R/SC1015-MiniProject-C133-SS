# SC1015-MiniProject-C133-SS
## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). This project is based on Employee Attribution, and the dataset has been obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jpmiller/employee-attrition-for-healthcare).

The [DataSet](https://github.com/shru384/SC1015-MiniProject-C133-SS/blob/main/watson_healthcare_modified.csv) and [Source Code](https://github.com/shru384/SC1015-MiniProject-C133-SS/blob/main/SC1015_C133_Shrutikhaa%26Sushmita.ipynb) can be accessed through the respective hyperlinks.

**Content Outline**: 
1. Cleaning of Data
2. Visualization of the Data
3. Exploratory Analysis
4. Machine Learning
5. Simple Neural Network
6. Findings and Summary

## Models Used
1. Random Forest
2. Logistic Regression 
3. Neural Networks

## Conclusion
The factors that affected employee attrition were:
1. MonthlyIncome
2. Age
3. DistanceFromHome
4. TotalWorkingYears
5. YearsAtCompany
6. YearsInCurrentRole
7. YearsWithCurrManager
8. EnvironmentSatisfaction
9. JobSatisfaction

Since MonthlyIncome has the strongest correlation of 0.95 with Attrition, it can be concluded that MonthlyIncome is a vital deciding factor.
